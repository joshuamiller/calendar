Calendar
========

Calendar is a view helper to draw out a calendar.  Today is highlighted and you can pass a block of code to the calendar to
add a special css class to those dates.

It is loaded on app startup and the helper is available to all views.

This plugin is an extension of Geoffrey Grosenbach's plugin, 'calender-helper'.


Example
=======
In your application layout:

<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'calendar/style' %>


For a simple calendar view use:

	<%= calendar(:year => Date.today.year, :month => Date.today.month, :table_class => "calendar") %>

To highlight an array of date use this:
	The example is finding a list of upcoming milestones.  It finds the dates in the records array through map and returns
	them telling the calendar to pass the class "with" to that td tag.
	
	<%= calendar(:year => Date.today.year, :month => Date.today.month, :table_class => "calendar") do |d| 
			if @milestones.map(&:date).include?(d)
				[d.mday, {:class => "with"}]
			end
		end %>
